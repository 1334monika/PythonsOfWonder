@YourLyricsGuy,"Lyrics:-
[Intro]
Stranger things
We're like, we're like a stranger things (very far)
We're stranger things (dream of places at)
Cause that's just who we are

[Verse 1]
We used to run around this ghost town
Always thinking out loud
Are we gonna get out
I remember
We dream of places that we could go
Castles with the strange glow
People that we don't know
I remember

[Pre-Chorus]
We left the light
That's ordinary from the start
We look for stranger things
'Cause that's just who we are
Found me the edges something beautiful than love
Like I'm picturing now

[Chorus]
Castles glitter under Spanish skies
But I'm just looking after you tonight
Snow and mountain to the foreign state
Tell me someday we'll get there
Someday
Someday
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
 

[Verse 2]
I see a Technicolor shadow
Underneath your window
Just in case you don't know
I can see it
You cast among an unfamiliar day glow
Different than what I know
Shining like a halo
I can feel it

[Pre-Chorus]
We turned our back
That's ordinary from the start
We look for stranger things
'Cause that's just who we are
Found me the edges something beautiful than love
Show me the sky falling down

[Chorus]
Castles glitter under Spanish skies
But I'm just looking after you tonight
Snow and mountain to the ancient place
Tell me someday we'll get together
Someday
Someday
Oh oh
Oh oh
 

[Bridge]

Far, for stranger things, a life, a life of stranger things (very far) for stranger things (dreams of places I've) 'Cause that's just who we are

We used to run around this ghost town
Always thinking out loud
How we're gonna get out
I remember

We dreamed of places that we could go
Castles with a strange glow
People that we don't know
I remember

We left a life that's ordinary from the start
We looked for stranger things 'cause that's just who we are
Find me the edge of something beautiful and loud
Like I'm picturing now

Castles greater under Spanish skies
Well I'm just looking out for you tonight
Snow white mountains in a foreign state
Tell me someday we'll get there
Someday (someday)

I see a technicolor shadow
Underneath your window
Just in case you don't know
I can see it

You cast an unfamiliar day glow
Different than what I know
Shining like a halo
I can feel it

We turned our back on ordinary from the start
We looked for stranger things 'cause that's just who we are
Find me the edge of something beautiful and loud
Show me the sky falling down

Castles greater under Spanish skies
Well I'm just looking out for you tonight
Snow white mountains in an ancient place
Tell me someday we'll get there
Someday (someday)

For stranger things, a life, a life of stranger things (very far) for stranger things (dreams of places I've) 'Cause that's just who we are (x5)"

@willian.pernia,"[Intro]
Stranger things
We're like, we're like a stranger things (very far)
We're stranger things (dream of places at)
Cause that's just who we are

[Verse 1]
We used to run around this ghost town
Always thinking out loud
Are we gonna get out
I remember
We dream of places that we could go
Castles with the strange glow
People that we don't know
I remember

[Pre-Chorus]
We left the light
That's ordinary from the start
We look for stranger things
'Cause that's just who we are
Found me the edges something beautiful than love
Like I'm picturing now

[Chorus]
Castles glitter under Spanish skies
But I'm just looking after you tonight
Snow and mountain to the foreign state
Tell me someday we'll get there
Someday
Someday
Oh-oh
Oh-oh

[Verse 2]
I see a Technicolor shadow
Underneath your window
Just in case you don't know
I can see it
You cast among an unfamiliar day glow
Different than what I know
Shining like a halo
I can feel it

[Pre-Chorus]
We turned our back
That's ordinary from the start
We look for stranger things
'Cause that's just who we are
Found me the edges something beautiful than love
Show me the sky falling down

[Chorus]
Castles glitter under Spanish skies
But I'm just looking after you tonight
Snow and mountain to the ancient place
Tell me someday we'll get together
Someday
Someday
Oh oh
Oh oh

[Bridge]
A stranger things
We're like, we're like a stranger things (very far)
We're stranger things (dream of places at)
Cause that's just who we are
A stranger things (very far)
We're like, we're like a stranger things (very far)
We're stranger things (dream of places at)
Cause that's just who we are
A stranger things
We're like, we're like a stranger things (very far)
We're stranger things (dream of places at)
Cause that's just who we are
A stranger things
We're like, we're like a stranger things (very far)
We're stranger things (dream of places at)
Cause that's just who we are

[Outro]
A stranger things
We're like, we're like a stranger things (very far)
We're stranger things (dream of places at)
Cause that's just who we are"

@vicecay551,"Love. It's difficult (or not). Many decisions to make. Many secrets to keep and reveal. I love this song. At first I didn't know why, but now I know. I'm a girl and well ... I like a friend and she doesn't know it. The title of this song makes me understand that with it I feel that we are ""stranger things."" I just want to say that I love Kygo, I love music. Music gives you clues about what is going through your head and your heart. So think about why you like that song; maybe it's nothing, or maybe it's everything. (hablo espa√±ol :3)"

@sarahalsioufy264,"This is so relating to the series, stranger things.

SPOILER ALERT VVV

""We used to run around this ghost town"" relating to the boys with their bikes when they always cycled around Hawkins.
""How we're gonna get out"" It relates to Will when he's in the Upside Down and he's trying to communicate with Joyce and everyone else to get out of the Upside Down.
""Castles with the strange glow"" When Eleven went to Castle Byers in season one and found Will there when she was communicating with him with her mind, The demogorgon came again so that's the 'strange glow'
""People that we don't know"" Eleven when she stayed at Mike's house and Lucas intended on not keeping her since she's a stranger
""We left a life that's ordinary from the start"" That relates to how their lives changed when Will was missing, their life changed from ordinary to strange.
""We looked for stranger things 'cause that's just who we are"" How Eleven was looking for the Mindflayer/Shadow Monster in season two and since she's also one of the 'strange things' in the series.

""But I'm just looking out for you tonight"" How Mike was always calling Eleven for 353 days.


""I see a Technicolor shadow, underneath your window"" When Eleven got out of the Upside Down and went to Mike's house in season two, the first chapter/episode.
""Just in case you don't know, I can see it"" How Mike saw Eleven behind the window but the guys that were at his house were looking and searching everywhere for her.

""We turned our back on ordinary from the start"" When they finally returned to being normal, but the Mindflayer/Shadow Monster came into their lives.

You're welcome."
